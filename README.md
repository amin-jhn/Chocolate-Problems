# Chocolate-Problems
This project consists of 3 main phases, the output produced in each phase is the input of the next phase:
1. In the first phase, we will review and analyze a data frame including all the chocolates we have.
2. In the second phase, by examining the types of chocolates, we will try to identify those that can be sold and determine their prices.
3. In the third phase, we will try to identify the top chocolate manufacturing companies and update the price of chocolates accordingly. In addition, we intend to calculate the income from the sale of such chocolates.
